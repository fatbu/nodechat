# nodechat
Simple, lightweight node.js chat server and client.
Code is based off the example at the socket.io website.
Sounds by theta4 from freesound.org.

## How to use
Preparation:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/fatbu/nodechat.git
$ cd nodechat
$ npm install
```
Use the branch eamon-mods, that is currently the more active branch.

######How to use
`node app`

The default port is 3000.

```
$ node app
listening on: 8080
Operator password: ****
local address: ***.***.***.***:3000
```

Then go to the address in a browser :)
localhost:8080 works too
Port forward for people outside your network to connect to the external address.
